# Snowflake Cortex Agents

## Overview

Cortex Agents orchestrate across both structured and unstructured data sources to deliver insights. They plan tasks, use tools to execute these tasks, and generate responses. Agents use Cortex Analyst (structured) and Cortex Search (unstructured) as tools, along with LLMs, to analyze data. Cortex Search extracts insights from unstructured sources, while Cortex Analyst generates SQL to process structured data. A comprehensive support for tool identification and tool execution enables delivery of sophisticated applications grounded in enterprise data.

## Key Components and Workflow

The Cortex Agents workflow involves four key components that work together to provide intelligent data analysis and insights:

### 1. Planning

Applications often switch between processing data from structured and unstructured sources. For example, consider a conversational app designed to answer user queries. A business user may first ask for top distributors by revenue (structured) and then switch to inquiring about a contract (unstructured). Cortex Agents can parse a request to orchestrate a plan and arrive at the solution or response.

#### Planning Capabilities:

**Explore Options**
- When the user poses an ambiguous question (for example, "Tell me about Acme Supplies"), the agent considers different permutations - products, location, or sales personnel - to disambiguate and improve accuracy

**Split into Subtasks**
- Cortex Agents can split a task or request (for example, "What are the differences between contract terms for Acme Supplies and Acme Stationery?") into multiple parts for a more precise response

**Route Across Tools**
- The agent selects the right tool - Cortex Analyst or Cortex Search - to ensure governed access and compliance with enterprise policies

### 2. Tool Use

With a plan in place, the agent retrieves data efficiently. Cortex Search extracts insights from unstructured sources, while Cortex Analyst generates SQL to process structured data. A comprehensive support for tool identification and tool execution enables delivery of sophisticated applications grounded in enterprise data.

#### Available Tools:

**Cortex Analyst (Structured Data)**
- Generates SQL queries to process structured data
- Handles business intelligence and analytics queries
- Provides accurate text-to-SQL conversion
- Integrates with Snowflake's data warehouse capabilities

**Cortex Search (Unstructured Data)**
- Extracts insights from unstructured sources
- Processes documents, text files, and other unstructured content
- Enables semantic search capabilities
- Handles natural language processing tasks

### 3. Reflection

After each tool use, the agent evaluates results to determine the next steps - asking for clarification, iterating, or generating a final response. This orchestration allows it to handle complex data queries while ensuring accuracy and compliance within Snowflake's secure perimeter.

#### Reflection Process:
- **Result Evaluation**: Assess the quality and completeness of tool outputs
- **Next Step Determination**: Decide whether to iterate, clarify, or provide final response
- **Accuracy Assurance**: Ensure responses meet quality standards
- **Compliance Verification**: Maintain adherence to enterprise policies

### 4. Monitor and Iterate

After deployment, customers can track metrics, analyze performance and refine behavior for continuous improvements. On the client application developers can use TruLens to monitor the Agent interaction. By continuously monitoring and refining governance controls, enterprises can confidently scale AI agents while maintaining security and compliance.

#### Monitoring Capabilities:
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor response times, accuracy, and user satisfaction
- **Metrics Analysis**: Analyze usage patterns and identify optimization opportunities
- **Behavior Refinement**: Continuously improve agent responses and decision-making
- **TruLens Integration**: Use TruLens for detailed agent interaction monitoring

## Architecture and Integration

### Hybrid Data Processing
Cortex Agents excel at handling scenarios that require both structured and unstructured data analysis:

**Example Use Cases:**
- Business user asks for "top distributors by revenue" (structured data via Cortex Analyst)
- Same user then asks about "contract terms" (unstructured data via Cortex Search)
- Agent seamlessly transitions between data types and tools

### Enterprise-Grade Capabilities
- **Governed Access**: Ensures compliance with enterprise data policies
- **Security Compliance**: Maintains security standards across all operations
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports enterprise-level deployment and usage
