# Snowflake Cortex Analyst

## Overview

Cortex Analyst is a fully-managed, LLM-powered Snowflake Cortex feature that helps you create applications capable of reliably answering business questions based on your structured data in Snowflake. With Cortex Analyst, business users can ask questions in natural language and receive direct answers without writing SQL. Available as a convenient REST API, Cortex Analyst can be seamlessly integrated into any application.

Building a production-grade conversational self-service analytics solution requires a service that generates accurate text-to-SQL responses. For most teams, developing such a service that successfully balances accuracy, latency, and costs is a daunting task. Cortex Analyst simplifies this process by providing a fully managed, sophisticated agentic AI system that handles all of these complexities, generating highly accurate text-to-SQL responses.

## Key Features

### Self-serve Analytics via Natural Language Queries
- Delight your business teams and non-technical users with instant answers and insights from their structured data in Snowflake
- Build downstream chat applications that allow users to ask questions using natural language and receive accurate answers on the fly

### Convenient REST API for Integration
- API-first approach, giving you full control over the end user experience
- Easily integrate Cortex Analyst into existing business tools and platforms:
  - Streamlit apps
  - Slack
  - Microsoft Teams
  - Custom chat interfaces
  - Other business workflows

### Powered by State-of-the-art Large Language Models
- **Default Models**: Powered by the latest Meta Llama and Mistral models, which run securely inside Snowflake Cortex
- **Optional Azure OpenAI**: Access to the latest Azure-hosted OpenAI GPT models
- **Intelligent Model Selection**: At runtime, Cortex Analyst selects the best combination of models to ensure the highest accuracy and performance for each query
- **Continuous Evolution**: Snowflake continues to explore adding more models to improve performance and accuracy

### Semantic Models for High Precision and Accuracy
- Generic AI solutions often struggle with text-to-SQL conversions when given only a database schema
- Schemas lack critical knowledge like business process definitions and metrics handling
- Cortex Analyst uses a semantic model to bridge the gap between business users and databases
- **Semantic Model Structure**: Captured in a lightweight YAML file
- **Rich Description**: Similar to database schemas but allows for richer description of semantic information around the data
- **Automatic Data Source Selection**: When set up with multiple data sources, Cortex Analyst can automatically figure out which one to use

## Security and Governance

### Privacy-First Foundation
- Snowflake's privacy-first foundation and enterprise-grade security ensure confident exploration of AI-driven use cases
- Data is protected by the highest standards of privacy and governance

### Data Governance Boundary
- **Data stays within Snowflake's governance boundary**: By default, Cortex Analyst is powered by Snowflake-hosted LLMs from Mistral and Meta, ensuring that no data, including metadata or prompts, leaves Snowflake's governance boundary
- **Azure OpenAI Option**: If you opt to use Azure OpenAI models, only metadata and prompts are transmitted outside of Snowflake's governance boundary

### No Training on Customer Data
- Cortex Analyst does not train on Customer Data
- Customer Data is not used to train or fine-tune any Model to be made available across the customer base
- **For Inference**: Cortex Analyst uses only the metadata provided in the semantic model YAML file (table names, column names, value type, descriptions, etc.) for SQL-query generation
- The generated SQL query is executed in your Snowflake virtual warehouse to generate the final output

### Seamless Integration with Snowflake's Privacy and Governance Features
- Fully integrates with Snowflake's role-based access control (RBAC) policies
- Ensures that SQL queries generated and executed adhere to all established access controls
- Guarantees robust security and governance for your data

## Technical Implementation

### Semantic Model Specification
- Semantic models are defined in YAML files
- Structure and concepts similar to database schemas
- Provides richer semantic information about the data
- Helps Cortex Analyst understand business context and metrics

### Query Processing
1. User asks a natural language question
2. Cortex Analyst analyzes the question using the semantic model
3. Generates appropriate SQL query
4. Executes the query against Snowflake data warehouse
5. Returns results to the user

### Performance Benefits
- Leverages Snowflake's scalable engine
- Industry-leading price performance
- Lower total cost of ownership (TCO)
- Avoids complex RAG solution patterns
- Eliminates need for model experimentation and GPU capacity planning
